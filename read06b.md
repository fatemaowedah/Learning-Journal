## All computers do the same 4 things
 * take input
 * store in storage
 * processing the data
 * output the results

## Binary & Data
 * computers work on ones & zeroes, but actually almost nobody deals directly with ones & zeros
 * inside computers wires & circuits carry all the information in a computer 

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
