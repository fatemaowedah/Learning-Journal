# Comparison operators 
## Evaluating Conditions :
* we can comparing one value in the script to what you expect.
* the result will be aboolean : true or false.
  * is equal to `==`this operator compare two value if they are same.
  * is not equal to `!=`this operator compare two value if they are not same.
  * strict equal to `===`this operator compare two value to check that both the data type and value are the same.
  * strict not equal to `!==`this operator compare two value to check that both the data type and value are note the same.
  * Grater than `>` this operator checks if the number on the left is grater than the number on right.
  * Less than `<` this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on right.
  * Greater than or equal to `>=`this operator checks if the number on the left is grater than or equal to the number on the right.
  * Less than or equal to `<=`this operator checks if the number on the left is grater than or equal to the number on the right.
*Logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than one comparison operator by :*
  * Logical and`&&`this operator test more than one condition.
  * Logical and`||`this operator at last one condition.
  * Logical and`!`this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverst it.
## Loop:
*loop if it return true,code block will run*
  * For loop `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { }`
    * `var i=0;` initalization
    * `i<10;` codition
    * `i++` update
  * while loop.
